# HyperionDev_CapstoneProjects

The purpose of this repository is to learn showcase all the capstone projects created by me as a part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp
Since then I've learned a lot more about development and programming

Current focus points:

1) - Refactoring other older repositories 
2) - Creating new projects in other coding languages including JavaScript, Ruby, C# and C++.

## Future plans for this repository

The prurpose of this repository is only to showcase the projects I submitted as a part of the bootcamp.
There are currently no plans to revisit these projects or update them further
